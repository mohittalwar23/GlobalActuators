This project uses Firebase's realtime database to control actuators from anywhere in the world via a kotlin android application 

I have used ESP32Firebase library for read/write on firebase easily without a python script just using a esp32 microcontroller

This is just a beginner level project integrating IOT and Android for Home Automation

This is highly cutomizable according to anyone's needs and is secure aswell because we can set the rules in firebase :)

Thanks!
